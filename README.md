# Biostats_Final_Project
This project focuses on an initial analysis of twitter data and is adopts code from Adil Moujahid's blog on how to pull the data and then analyze it using other programs. It was created for a school project at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. The code and references are included below. 
To run these codes please use them in order. Please note you will need to sign up for a Twitter App and obtain your own API and Secret Keys to run this code. While this project uses these specific columns for the data and the graphs are pulled for this project specifically, feel free to adapt the code in whatever form you wish. Please be sure to credit those who did the main work behind these codes as this is largely an adaptation from a number of online resources I found.
There are three main files:
  1. Programs - Run these programs in order. 1_twitter_streaming.py should be adapted and run in console with a well-established internet connection (I recommend running this as 1_twitter_streaming.py>text_data.txt as doing otherwise will not save the data and just fill up your console.
  2. Plots - These are plots that I have created for my specific project. Each plot was created individually and then combined for clarity using PowerPoint as I did not have the time to make every plot a side by side plot.
  3. Data - The initial pull data sets are included if you just want to run my code. I have also included the final RCode data set if you would rather skip the first two Python steps though I do not recommend this.
